        <h2 id="summer">Summer</h2>
        <p>He's a happy snowman, doing what frozen things do in summer.<br/>
        Bees a-buzzin', kissable dandelion fuzz<br/>
And I'll be doin' whatever snow does in summerrrrrr<br/>
A drink in my hand, my snow up against the burning sand<br/>
Probably getting gorgeously tanned in summerrrrr<br/>
</p>

<p>I'll finally see a summer breeze, blow away a winter storm<br/>
      And find out what happens to solid water when it gets warm!<br/>
      And I can't wait to see, what my buddies all think of me<br/>
      Just imagine how much cooler I'll be in summerrrrrr<br/>
</p>

<p>Da da, da doo, a bubba bubba boo<br/>
      The hot and the cold are both so intense<br/>
      Put them together ? it just makes sense!<br/>
</p>

        <h2 id="winter">Winter</h2>

        <p id="olaf-song">He likes to stay in and cuddle <br/>
            The snow glows white<br/>
on the mountain tonight,<br/>
not a footprint to be seen.<br/>
A kingdom of isolation and it looks<br/>
like I’m the queen.
        </p>

        <p>
            The wind is howling like this<br/>
swirling storm inside.<br/>
Couldn’t keep it in, Heaven knows I tried.<br/>
Don’t let them in, don’t let them see.<br/>
Be the good girl you always have to be.<br/>
Conceal don’t feel, don’t let them know.<br/>
Well, now they know!<br/>
